Standalone Server\n\nFor many use cases, the centralized management capability available via a managed domain is not necessary. For these use cases, a WildFly instance can be run as a \"standalone server\". A standalone server instance is an independent process, much like an JBoss Application Server 3, 4, 5, or 6 instance is. Standalone instances can be launched via the standalone.sh or standalone.bat launch scripts.\n\nIf more than one standalone instance is launched and multi-server management is desired, it is the userâ€™s responsibility to coordinate management across the servers. For example, to deploy an application across all of the standalone servers, the user would need to individually deploy the application on each server.\n\nIt is perfectly possible to launch multiple standalone server instances and have them form an HA cluster, just like it was possible with JBoss Application Server 3, 4, 5 and 6.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"2.

Managed Domain\n\nOne of the primary new features of WildFly is the ability to manage multiple WildFly instances from a single control point. A collection of such servers is referred to as the members of a \"domain\" with a single Domain Controller process acting as the central management control point. All of the WildFly instances in the domain share a common management policy, with the Domain Controller acting to ensure that each server is configured according to that policy. Domains can span multiple physical (or virtual) machines, with all WildFly instances on a given host under the control of a special Host Controller process. One Host Controller instance is configured to act as the central Domain Controller. The Host Controller on each host interacts with the Domain Controller to control the lifecycle of the application server instances running on its host and to assist the Domain Controller in managing them.\n\nWhen you launch a WildFly managed domain on a host (via the domain.sh or domain.bat launch scripts) your intent is to launch a Host Controller and usually at least one WildFly instance. On one of the hosts the Host Controller should be configured to act as the Domain Controller. See Domain Setup for details.\n\nThe following is an example managed domain topology:\n\nHost\n\nEach \"Host\" box in the above diagram represents a physical or virtual host.

to act as the central management point for the entire domain, i.e. to be the Domain Controller. The primary responsibility of the Domain Controller is to maintain the domainâ€™s central management policy, to ensure all Host Controllers are aware of its current contents, and to assist the Host Controllers in ensuring any running application server instances are configured in accordance with this policy. This central management policy is stored by default in the domain/configuration/domain.xml file in the unzipped WildFly installation on Domain Controllerâ€™s hostâ€™s filesystem.\n\nA domain.xml file must be located in the domain/configuration directory of an installation thatâ€™s meant to run the Domain Controller. It does not need to be present in installations that are not meant to run a Domain Controller; i.e. those whose Host Controller is configured to contact a remote Domain Controller.

The domain configuration also includes the definition of groups of sockets that those subsystems may open. The domain configuration also includes the definition of \"server groups\":\n\nServer Group\n\nA server group is set of server instances that will be managed and configured as one. In a managed domain each application server instance is a member of a server group. (Even if the group only has a single server, the server is still a member of a group.) It is the responsibility of the Domain Controller and the Host Controllers to ensure that all servers in a server group have a consistent configuration.

a managed domain each application server instance is a member of a server group.\n\n(Even if the group only has a single server, the server is still a member of a group.)\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Domain Controller and the Host Controllers to ensure that all servers in a server group have a consistent configuration.\n\nThey should all be configured with the same profile and they should have the same deployment content deployed.\n\nThe domain can have multiple server groups. The above diagram shows two server groups, \"ServerGroupA\" and \"ServerGroupB\". Different server groups can be configured with different profiles and deployments; for example in a domain with different tiers of servers ï»¿providing different services.

Deciding between running standalone servers or a managed domain\n\nWhich use cases are appropriate for managed domain and which are appropriate for standalone servers? A managed domain is all about coordinated multi-server managementâ€‰â€”â€‰with it WildFly provides a central point through which users can manage multiple servers, with rich capabilities to keep those servers\u0027 configurations consistent and the ability to roll out configuration changes (including deployments) to the servers in a coordinated fashion.\n\nItâ€™s important to understand that the choice between a managed domain and standalone servers is all about how your servers are managed, not what capabilities they have to service end user requests. This distinction is particularly important when it comes to high availability clusters. Itâ€™s important to understand that HA functionality is orthogonal to running standalone servers or a managed domain. That is, a group of standalone servers can be configured to form an HA cluster.

For these enterprises, a multi-server architecture comprised of individual standalone servers is a good option.\n\n*  Running a standalone server is better suited for most development scenarios. Any individual server configuration that can be achieved in a managed domain can also be achieved in a standalone server, so even if the application being developed will eventually run in production on a managed domain installation, much (probably most) development can be done using a standalone server.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"2.

Relationship to feature-packs\n\nThe Galleon feature-packs that WildFly produces themselves incorporate expectations for long-term feature stability and compatibility. The --stability startup setting discussed above just allows users to use a different setting than the standard one for the feature-pack.\n\n*  wildfly-eeâ€‰â€”â€‰This feature-pack is not widely used directly and WildFly does not produce any downloadable zip/tar built solely using it. However, it is transparently used internally in provisioning any standard WildFly installation, and most standard WildFly functionality is provisioned from this feature-pack. It can be used directly by users who wish to limit their installation to what it provides.

The primary reason things are provided in this feature-pack instead of wildfly-ee is because the technology that is integrated is more likely to change in incompatible ways over a relatively short time period. For example, MicroProfile specifications are comfortable introducing breaking changes on an annual basis, making them a poor fit for wildfly-ee.

Profiles and Subsystems\n\nThe most significant part of the configuration in domain.xml and standalone.xml is the configuration of one (in standalone.xml) or more (in domain.xml) \"profiles\". A profile is a named set of subsystem configurations. A subsystem is an added set of capabilities added to the core server by an extension (see \"Extensions\" above). A subsystem provides servlet handling capabilities; a subsystem provides an Jakarta Enterprise Beans container; a subsystem provides Jakarta Transactions, etc. A profile is a named list of subsystems, along with the details of each subsystemâ€™s configuration. A profile with a large number of subsystems results in a server with a large set of capabilities. A profile with a small, focused set of subsystems will have fewer capabilities but a smaller footprint.\n\nThe content of an individual profile configuration looks largely the same in domain.xml and standalone.xml. The only difference is standalone.xml is only allowed to have a single profile element (the profile the server will run), while domain.xml can have many profiles, each of which can be mapped to one or more groups of servers.\n\nThe contents of individual subsystem configurations look exactly the same between domain.xml and standalone.xml.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"2.

Script Configuration Files\n\nScripts are located in the $JBOSS_HOME/bin directory. Within this directory you will find script configuration files for standalone and domain startup scripts for each platform. These files can be used to configure your environment without having to edit the scripts themselves. For example, you can configure the JAVA_OPTS environment variable to configure the JVM before the container is launched.\n\nStandalone Script Configuration Files:\n\n*  standalone.conf invoked from standalone.sh\n\n*  standalone.conf.bat invoked from standalone.bat\n\n*  standalone.conf.ps1 invoked from standalone.ps1\n\nDomain Script Configuration Files:\n\n*  domain.conf invoked from domain.sh\n\n*  domain.conf.bat invoked from domain.bat\n\n*  domain.conf.ps1 invoked from domain.ps1\n\nBy default, these are in the $JBOSS_HOME/bin directory. However, you can set the STANDALONE_CONF environment variable for standalone servers or DOMAIN_CONF environment variable for domain servers with a value of the absolute path to the file.\n\nCommon Script Configuration Files\n\nStarting with WildFly 23, common configuration files were introduced. These files are invoked from every script in the $JBOSS_HOME/bin directory. While these configuration files are not present in the directory by default, they can be added.

Address\n\nAll WildFly management resources are organized in a tree. The path to the node in the tree for a particular resource is its address. Each segment in a resourceâ€™s address is a key/value pair:\n\n*  The key is the resourceâ€™s type, in the context of its parent. So, for example, the root resource for a standalone server has children of type subsystem, interface, socket-binding, etc. The resource for the subsystem that provides the ASâ€™s webserver capability has children of type connector and virtual-server. The resource for the subsystem that provides the ASâ€™s messaging server capability has, among others, children of type jms-queue and jms-topic.\n\n*  The value is the name of a particular resource of the given type, e.g web or messaging for subsystems or http or https for web subsystem connectors.\n\nThe full address for a resource is the ordered list of key/value pairs that lead from the root of the tree to the resource. Typical notation is to separate the elements in the address with a \u0027/\u0027 and to separate the key and the value with an \u0027\u003d\u0027:\n\n*  /subsystem\u003dundertow/server\u003ddefault-server/http-listener\u003ddefault\n\n*  /subsystem\u003dmessaging/jms-queue\u003dtestQueue\n\n*  /interface\u003dpublic\n\nWhen using the HTTP API, a \u0027/\u0027 is used to separate the key and the value instead of an \u0027\u003d\u0027:\n\n*  http://localhost:9990/management/subsystem/undertow/server/default-server/http-listener/default\n\n*  http://localhost:9990/management/subsystem/messaging/jms-queue/testQueue","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"2.

Operations\n\nQuerying or modifying the state of a resource is done via an operation. An operation has the following characteristics:\n\n*  A string name\n\n*  Zero or more named parameters. Each parameter has a string name, and a value of type org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode (or, when invoked via the CLI, the text representation of a ModelNode; when invoked via the HTTP API, the JSON representation of a ModelNode.) Parameters may be optional.\n\n*  A return value, which will be of type org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode (or, when invoked via the CLI, the text representation of a ModelNode; when invoked via the HTTP API, the JSON representation of a ModelNode.)\n\nEvery resource except the root resource will have an add operation and should have a remove operation (\"should\" because in WildFly 31 many do not). The parameters for the add operation vary depending on the resource. The remove operation has no parameters.\n\nThere are also a number of \"global\" operations that apply to all resources.

Attributes\n\nManagement resources expose information about their state as attributes. Attributes have string name, and a value of type org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode (or: for the CLI, the text representation of a ModelNode; for HTTP API, the JSON representation of a ModelNode.)\n\nAttributes can either be read-only or read-write. Reading and writing attribute values is done via the global read-attribute and write-attribute operations.\n\nThe read-attribute operation takes a single parameter \"name\" whose value is a the name of the attribute. For example, to read the \"port\" attribute of a socket-binding resource via the CLI:\n    [standalone@localhost:9990 /] /socket-binding-group\u003dstandard-sockets/socket-binding\u003dhttps:read-attribute(name\u003dport) { \"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\", \"result\" \u003d\u003e 8443 }    \nIf an attribute is writable, the write-attribute operation is used to mutate its state. The operation takes two parameters:\n\n*  name â€“ the name of the attribute\n\n*  value â€“ the value of the attribute\n\nFor example, to read the \"port\" attribute of a socket-binding resource via the CLI:\n    [standalone@localhost:9990 /] /socket-binding-group\u003dstandard-sockets/socket-binding\u003dhttps:write-attribute(name\u003dport,value\u003d8444) {\"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\"}    \nAttributes can have one of two possible storage types:\n\n*  CONFIGURATION â€“ means the value of the attribute is stored in the persistent configuration; i.e. in the domain.xml, host.xml or standalone.xml file from which the resourceâ€™s configuration was read.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"2.

Attribute Value with an Environment Variable\n\nIt is possible to override the value of any simple attribute by providing an environment variable with a name that maps to the attribute (and its resource).\n\nComplex attributes (which have their type set to LIST, OBJECT, or PROPERTY) can not be overridden using an environment variable.\n\nIf there is an environment variable with such a name, the management resource will use the value of this environment variable when the management resource validates and sets the attribute value. This takes place before the attribute value is resolved (if it contains an expression) or corrected.\n\nThis feature is disabled by default.

Children\n\nManagement resources may support child resources. The types of children a resource supports (e.g. connector for the web subsystem resource) can be obtained by querying the resourceâ€™s description (see Descriptions below) or by invoking the read-children-types operation. Once you know the legal child types, you can query the names of all children of a given type by using the global read-children-types operation. The operation takes a single parameter \"child-type\" whose value is the type. For example, a resource representing a socket binding group has children. To find the type of those children and the names of resources of that type via the CLI one could:\n    [standalone@localhost:9990 /] /socket-binding-group\u003dstandard-sockets:read-children-types { \"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\", \"result\" \u003d\u003e [\"socket-binding\"] } [standalone@localhost:9990 /] /socket-binding-group\u003dstandard-sockets:read-children-names(child-type\u003dsocket-binding) { \"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\", \"result\" \u003d\u003e [ \"http\", \"https\", \"jmx-connector-registry\", \"jmx-connector-server\", \"jndi\", \"remoting\", \"txn-recovery-environment\", \"txn-status-manager\" ] }","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"2.

Comparison to JMX MBeans\n\nWildFly management resources are conceptually quite similar to Open MBeans. They have the following primary differences:\n\n*  WildFly management resources are organized in a tree structure. The order of the key value pairs in a resourceâ€™s address is significant, as it defines the resourceâ€™s position in the tree.

HTTP Management Endpoint\n\nThe HTTP API endpoint is the entry point for management clients that rely on the HTTP protocol to integrate with the management layer. It uses a JSON encoded protocol and a de-typed, RPC style API to describe and execute management operations against a managed domain or standalone server. Itâ€™s used by the web console, but offers integration capabilities for a wide range of other clients too.\n\nThe HTTP API endpoint is co-located with either the domain controller or a standalone server.

Non-interactive Mode\n\nThe CLI can also be run in non-interactive mode to support scripts and other types of command line or batch processing. The --command and --commands arguments can be used to pass a command or a list of commands to execute. Additionally a --file argument is supported which enables CLI commands to be provided from a text file.\n\nFor example the following command can be used to list all the current deployments\n    $ ./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --commands\u003dls\\ deployment sample.war business.jar    \nThe output can be combined with other shell commands for further processing, for example to find out what .war files are deployed:\n    $ ./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --commands\u003dls\\ deployment | grep war sample.war    \nIn order to match a command with its output, you can provide the option --echo-command (or add the XML element \u003cecho-command\u003e to the CLI configuration file) in order to make the CLI to include the prompt\n command + options in the output. With this option enabled, any executed command will be added to the output.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"3.

Command timeout\n\nBy default CLI command and operation executions are not timely bounded. It means that a command never ending its execution will make the CLI process to be stuck and unresponsive. To protect the CLI from this behavior, one can set a command execution timeout.\n\nCommand Timeout behavior\n\nIn interactive mode, when a timeout occurs, an error message is displayed then the console prompt is made available to type new commands. In non interactive mode (executing a script or a list of commands), when a timeout occurs, an exception is thrown and the CLI execution is stopped. In both modes (interactive and non interactive), when a timeout occurs, the CLI will make a best effort to cancel the associated server side activities.\n\nConfiguring the Command timeout\n\n*  Add the XML element \u003ccommand-timeout\u003e\\{num seconds}\u003c/command-timeout\u003e to the CLI XML configuration file.\n\n*  Add the option - -command-timeout\u003d\\{num seconds} to the CLI command line. This will override any value set in the XML configuration file.\n\nManaging the Command Timeout\n\nOnce the CLI is running, the timeout can be adjusted to cope with the commands to execute.

Operation Requests\n\nOperation requests allow for low level interaction with the management model. They are different from the high level commands (i.e. create-jms-queue) in that they allow you to read and modify the server configuration as if you were editing the XML configuration files directly. The configuration is represented as a tree of addressable resources, where each node in the tree (aka resource) offers a set of operations to execute.\n\nAn operation request basically consists of three parts: The address, an operation name and an optional set of parameters.\n\nThe formal specification for an operation request is:\n    [/node-type\u003dnode-name (/node-type\u003dnode-name)*] : operation-name [( [parameter-name\u003dparameter-value (,parameter-name\u003dparameter-value)*] )]    \nFor example:\n    /subsystem\u003dlogging/root-logger\u003dROOT:change-root-log-level(level\u003dWARN)    \nTab Completion\n\nTab-completion is supported for all commands and options, i.e. node-types and node-names, operation names and parameter names.\n\nIn operation Tab-completion, required parameters have a name terminated by the \u0027*\u0027 character. This helps identify which are the parameters that must be set in order to construct a valid operation.

Command History\n\nCommand (and operation request) history is enabled by default. The history is kept both in-memory and in a file on the disk, i.e. it is preserved between command line sessions. The history file name is .jboss-cli-history and is automatically created in the userâ€™s home directory. When the command line interface is launched this file is read and the in-memory history is initialized with its content.\n\nWhile in the command line session, you can use the arrow keys to go back and forth in the history of commands and operations.      \nTo manipulate the history you can use the history command. If executed without any arguments, it will print all the recorded commands and operations (up to the configured maximum, which defaults to 500) from the in-memory history.\n\nhistory supports three optional arguments:\n\n*  disable - will disable history expansion (but will not clear the previously recorded history);\n\n*  enabled - will re-enable history expansion (starting from the last recorded command before the history expansion was disabled);\n\n*  clear - will clear the in-memory history (but not the file one).","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"3.

Managed Domain Configuration Files\n\nIn a managed domain, the XML files are found in the domain/configuration directory. There are two types of configuration files â€“ one per host, and then a single domain-wide file managed by the primary Host Controller, aka the Domain Controller. (For more on the types of processes in a managed domain, see Operating Modes.)\n\nHost Specific Configuration â€“ host.xml\n\nWhen you start a managed domain process, a Host Controller instance is launched, and it parses its own configuration file to determine its own configuration, how it should integrate with the rest of the domain, any host-specific values for settings in the domain wide configuration (e.g. IP addresses) and what servers it should launch. This information is contained in the host-specific configuration file, the default version of which is domain/configuration/host.xml.\n\nEach host will have its own variant host.xml, with settings appropriate for its role in the domain. WildFly ships with three standard variants:\n\nhost-primary.xml A configuration that specifies the Host Controller should become the primary Host Controller, aka the Domain Controller.

Stack and address preference\n\nThe system properties java.net.preferIPv4Stack and java.net.preferIPv6Addresses are used to configure the JVM for use with IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. With WildFly, in order to run using IPv4 addresses, you need to specify java.net.preferIPv4Stack\u003dtrue; in order to run with IPv6 addresses, you need to specify java.net.preferIPv4Stack\u003dfalse (the JVM default) and java.net.preferIPv6Addresses\u003dtrue. The latter ensures that any hostname to IP address conversions always return IPv6 address variants.\n\nThese system properties are conveniently set by the JAVA_OPTS environment variable, defined in the standalone.conf (or domain.conf) file. For example, to change the IP stack preference from its default of IPv4 to IPv6, edit the standalone.conf (or domain.conf) file and change its default IPv4 setting:\n    if [ \"x$JAVA_OPTS\" \u003d \"x\" ]; then JAVA_OPTS\u003d\" ... -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack\u003dtrue ...\" ...    \nto an IPv6 suitable setting:\n    if [ \"x$JAVA_OPTS\" \u003d \"x\" ]; then JAVA_OPTS\u003d\" ... -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack\u003dfalse -Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses\u003dtrue ...\" ...","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"4.

Access Control Providers\n\nWildFly ships with two access control \"providers\", the \"simple\" provider, and the \"rbac\" provider. The \"simple\" provider is the default, and provides a permission scheme equivalent to the JBoss AS 7 behavior where any authenticated administrator has all permissions. The \"rbac\" provider gives the finer grained permission scheme that is the focus of this section.\n\nThe access control configuration is included in the management section of a standalone serverâ€™s standalone.xml, or in a new \"management\" section in a managed domainâ€™s domain.xml. The access control policy is centrally configured in a managed domain.\n    \u003cmanagement\u003e . . . \u003caccess-control provider\u003d\"simple\"\u003e \u003crole-mapping\u003e \u003crole name\u003d\"SuperUser\"\u003e \u003cinclude\u003e \u003cuser name\u003d\"$local\"/\u003e \u003c/include\u003e \u003c/role\u003e \u003c/role-mapping\u003e \u003c/access-control\u003e \u003c/management\u003e    \nAs you can see, the provider is set to \"simple\" by default. With the \"simple\" provider, the nested \"role-mapping\" section is not actually relevant. Itâ€™s there to help ensure that if the provider attribute is switched to \"rbac\" there will be at least one user mapped to a role that can continue to administer the system. This default mapping assigns the \"$local\" user name to the RBAC role that provides all permissions, the \"SuperUser\" role. The \"$local\" user name is the name an administrator will be assigned if he or she uses the CLI on the same system as the WildFly instance and the \"local\" authentication scheme is enabled.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"5.

RBAC provider overview\n\nThe access control scheme implemented by the \"rbac\" provider is based on seven standard roles. A role is a named set of permissions to perform one of the actions: addressing (i.e. looking up) a management resource, reading it, or modifying it. The different roles have constraints applied to their permissions that are used to determine whether the permission is granted.\n\nRBAC roles\n\nThe seven standard roles are divided into two broad categories, based on whether the role can deal with items that are considered to be \"security sensitive\". Resources, attributes and operations that may affect administrative security (e.g. security realm resources and attributes that contain passwords) are \"security sensitive\".\n\nFour roles are not given permissions for \"security sensitive\" items:\n\n*  Monitor â€“ a read-only role. Cannot modify any resource.\n\n*  Operator â€“ Monitor permissions, plus can modify runtime state, but cannot modify anything that ends up in the persistent configuration.

roles are granted permissions for security sensitive items:\n\n*  SuperUser â€“ has all permissions.\n\nEquivalent to a JBoss AS 7 administrator.\n\n*  Administrator â€“ has all permissions except cannot read or write resources related to the administrative audit logging system.\n\n*  Auditor â€“ can read anything.\n\nCan only modify the resources related to the administrative audit logging system.\n\nThe Auditor and Administrator roles are meant for organizations that want a separation of responsibilities between those who audit normal administrative actions and those who perform them, with those who perform most actions (Administrator role) not being able to read or alter the auditing configuration.\n\nAccess control constraints\n\nThe following factors are used to determine whether a given role is granted a permission:\n\n*  What the requested action is (address, read, write)\n\n*  Whether the resource, attribute or operation affects the persistent configuration\n\n*  Whether the resource, attribute or operation is related to the administrative audit logging function\n\n*  Whether the resource, attribute or operation is configured as security sensitive\n\n*

The latter two actions are fairly self-explanatory. But what is meant by \"addressing\" a resource?\n\n\"Addressing\" a resource refers to taking an action that allows the user to determine whether a resource at a given address actually exists. For example, the \"read-children-names\" operation lets a user determine valid addresses.

latter two actions are fairly self-explanatory.\n\nBut what is meant by \"addressing\" a resource?\n\n\"Addressing\" a resource refers to taking an action that allows the user to determine whether a resource at a given address actually exists.\n\nFor example, the \"read-children-names\" operation lets a user determine valid addresses.\n\nTrying to read a resource and getting a \"Permission denied\" error also gives the user a clue that there actually is a resource at the requested address.\n\nSome resources may include sensitive information as part of their address. For example, security realm resources include the realm name as the last element in the address. That realm name is potentially security sensitive; for example it is part of the data used when creating a hash of a user password. Because some addresses may contain security sensitive data, a user needs permission to even \"address\" a resource. If a user attempts to address a resource and does not have permission, they will not receive a \"permission denied\" type error. Rather, the system will respond as if the resource does not even exist, e.g. excluding the resource from the result of the \"read-children-names\" operation or responding with a \"No such resource\" error instead of \"Permission denied\" if the user is attempting to read or write the resource.\n\nAnother term for \"addressing\" a resource is \"looking up\" the resource.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"5.

Switching to the \"rbac\" provider\n\nUse the CLI to switch the access-control provider.\n\nBefore changing the provider to \"rbac\", be sure your configuration has a user who will be mapped to one of the RBAC roles, preferably with at least one in the Administrator or SuperUser role. Otherwise your installation will not be manageable except by shutting it down and editing the xml configuration. If you have started with one of the standard xml configurations shipped with WildFly, the \"$local\" user will be mapped to the \"SuperUser\" role and the \"local\" authentication scheme will be enabled. This will allow a user running the CLI on the same system as the WildFly process to have full administrative permissions. Remote CLI users and web-based admin console users will have no permissions.      \nWe recommend mapping at least one user besides \"$local\" before switching the provider to \"rbac\".

Mapping users and groups to roles\n\nOnce the \"rbac\" access control provider is enabled, only users who are mapped to one of the available roles will have any administrative permissions at all. So, to make RBAC useful, a mapping between individual users or groups of users and the available roles must be performed.\n\nMapping individual users\n\nThe easiest way to map individual users to roles is to use the web-based admin console.\n\nNavigate to the \"Administration\" tab and the \"Users\" subtab.

to make RBAC useful, a mapping between individual users or groups of users and the available roles must be performed.\nMapping individual users\nThe easiest way to map individual users to roles is to use the web-based admin console.\nNavigate to the \"Administration\" tab and the \"Users\" subtab.\nFrom there individual user mappings can be added, removed, or edited.\nThe CLI can also be used to map individuals users to roles.\nFirst, if one does not exist, create the parent resource for all mappings for a role.

groups\n\nA \"group\" is an arbitrary collection of users that may exist in the end user environment. They can be named whatever the end user organization wants and can contain whatever users the end user organization wants. Some of the authentication store types supported by WildFly security realms include the ability to access information about what groups a user is a member of and associate this information with the Subject produced when the user is authenticated. This is currently supported for the following authentication store types:\n\n*  properties file (via the \u003crealm_name\u003e-groups.properties file)\n\n*  LDAP (via directory-server-specific configuration)\n\nGroups are convenient when it comes to associating a user with a role, since entire groups can be associated with a role in a single mapping.\n\nMapping groups to roles\n\nThe easiest way to map groups to roles is to use the web-based admin console.\n\nNavigate to the \"Administration\" tab and the \"Groups\" subtab.

 LDAP (via directory-server-specific configuration)\n\nGroups are convenient when it comes to associating a user with a role, since entire groups can be associated with a role in a single mapping.\n\nMapping groups to roles\n\nThe easiest way to map groups to roles is to use the web-based admin console.\n\nNavigate to the \"Administration\" tab and the \"Groups\" subtab.\n\nFrom there group mappings can be added, removed, or edited.\n\nThe CLI can also be used to map groups to roles. The only difference to individual user mapping is the value of the type attribute should be GROUP instead of USER.\n    [domain@localhost:9990 /] /core-service\u003dmanagement/access\u003dauthorization/role-mapping\u003dAdministrator/include\u003dgroup-SeniorAdmins:add(name\u003dSeniorAdmins,type\u003dGROUP) { \"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\", \"result\" \u003d\u003e undefined, \"server-groups\" \u003d\u003e {\"main-server-group\" \u003d\u003e {\"host\" \u003d\u003e {\"primary\" \u003d\u003e { \"server-one\" \u003d\u003e {\"response\" \u003d\u003e {\"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\"}}, \"server-two\" \u003d\u003e {\"response\" \u003d\u003e {\"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\"}} }}}} }     \nIncluding all authenticated users in a role\n\nItâ€™s possible to specify that all authenticated users should be mapped to a particular role.

Adding custom roles in a managed domain\n\nA managed domain may involve a variety of servers running different configurations and hosting different applications. In such an environment, it is likely that there will be different teams of administrators responsible for different parts of the domain. To allow organizations to grant permissions to only parts of a domain, WildFlyâ€™s RBAC scheme allows for the creation of custom \"scoped roles\". Scoped roles are based on the seven standard roles, but with permissions limited to a portion of the domain â€“ either to a set of server groups or to a set of hosts.\n\nServer group scoped roles\n\nThe privileges for a server-group scoped role are constrained to resources associated with one or more server groups. Server groups are often associated with a particular application or set of applications; organizations that have separate teams responsible for different applications may find server-group scoped roles useful.\n\nA server-group scoped role is equivalent to the default role upon which it is based, but with privileges constrained to target resources in the resource trees rooted in the server group resources.

server-group scoped role is equivalent to the default role upon which it is based, but with privileges constrained to target resources in the resource trees rooted in the server group

Group\n\n*  Deployment\n\n*  Deployment override\n\n*  Server group\n\n*  Server config\n\n*  Server\n\nResources in the profile, socket binding group, server config and server portions of the tree that are not logically related to a server group associated with the server-group scoped role will not be addressable by a user in that role. So, in a domain with server groups \"a\" and \"b\", a user in a server-group scoped role that grants access to \"a\" will not be able to address /server-group\u003db.

host-scoped role is equivalent to the default role upon which it is based, but with privileges constrained to target resources in the resource trees rooted in the host resources for one or more specified hosts.\n\nIn addition to these privileges, users in a host-scoped role will have non-sensitive read privileges (equivalent to the Monitor role) for domain wide resources (i.e. those not in

host-scoped role. So, in a domain with hosts \"a\" and \"b\", a user in a host-scoped role that grants access to \"a\" will not be able to address /host\u003db.

For example, if your organization doesnâ€™t regard reading vault expressions to be security sensitive, you can change that setting:\n[domain@localhost:9990 constraint\u003dvault-expression] :write-attribute(name\u003dconfigured-requires-read,value\u003dfalse) { \"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\", \"result\" \u003d\u003e undefined, \"server-groups\" \u003d\u003e {\"main-server-group\" \u003d\u003e {\"host\" \u003d\u003e {\"primary\" \u003d\u003e { \"server-one\" \u003d\u003e {\"response\" \u003d\u003e {\"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\"}}, \"server-two\" \u003d\u003e {\"response\" \u003d\u003e {\"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\"}} }}}} }\nThis vault-expression constraint overlaps somewhat with the core \"credential\" sensitivity classification in that the most typical uses of a vault expression are in attributes that contain a user name or password, and those will typically be annotated with the \"credential\" sensitivity classification.

if you change the settings for the \"credential\" sensitivity classification you may also need to make a corresponding change to the vault-expression constraint settings, or your change will not have full effect.\n\nBe aware though, that vault expressions can be used in any attribute that supports expressions, not just in credential-type attributes.\n\nSo it is important to be familiar with where and how your organization uses vault expressions before changing these settings.\n\nConfiguring \"Deployer\" role access\n\nThe standard Deployer role has its write permissions limited to resources that are considered to be \"application resources\"; i.e. conceptually part of an application and not part of the general server configuration. By default, only deployment resources are considered to be application resources. However, different organizations may have different opinions on what qualifies as an application resource, so for resource types that subsystems authors consider potentially to be application resources, WildFly provides a configuration option to declare them as such.

default, only deployment resources are considered to be application resources.\n\nHowever, different organizations may have different opinions on what qualifies as an application resource, so for resource types that subsystems authors consider potentially to be application resources, WildFly provides a configuration option to declare them as such.\n\nSuch resources will be annotated with an \"application classification\".\n\nFor example, the mail subsystem provides such a classification:\n    [domain@localhost:9990 /] cd /core-service\u003dmanagement/access\u003dauthorization/constraint\u003dapplication-classification/type\u003dmail/classification\u003dmail-session [domain@localhost:9990 classification\u003dmail-session] ls -l ATTRIBUTE VALUE TYPE configured-application undefined BOOLEAN default-application false BOOLEAN CHILD MIN-OCCURS MAX-OCCURS applies-to n/a n/a    \nUse read-resource or read-children-resources to see what resources have this classification applied:\n    [domain@localhost:9990 classification\u003dmail-session] :read-children-resources(child-type\u003dapplies-to) { \"outcome\" \u003d\u003e \"success\", \"result\" \u003d\u003e {\"/profile\u003d*/subsystem\u003dmail/mail-session\u003d*\" \u003d\u003e { \"address\" \u003d\u003e \"/profile\u003d*/subsystem\u003dmail/mail-session\u003d*\", \"attributes\" \u003d\u003e [], \"entire-resource\" \u003d\u003e true, \"operations\" \u003d\u003e [] }} }    \nThis indicates that this classification, intuitively enough, only applies to mail subsystem mail-session

RBAC effect on administrator user experience\n\nThe RBAC scheme will result in reduced permissions for administrators who do not map to the SuperUser role, so this will of course have some impact on their experience when using administrative tools like the admin console and the CLI.\n\nAdmin console\n\nThe admin console takes great pains to provide a good user experience even when the user has reduced permissions. Resources the user is not permitted to see will simply not be shown, or if appropriate will be replaced in the UI with an indication that the user is not authorized.

trim-descriptions was used as the value for the access-control parameter, the typical \"description\", \"attributes\", \"operations\" and \"children\" data is largely suppressed.

The access-control field includes information about the permissions the current caller has for this resource. The default section shows the default settings for resources of this type.

\"Run-as\" capability for SuperUsers\n\nIf a user maps to the SuperUser role, WildFly also supports letting that user request that they instead map to one or more other roles. This can be useful when doing demos, or when the SuperUser is changing the RBAC configuration and wants to see what effect the changes have from the perspective of a user in another role. This capability is only available to the SuperUser role, so it can only be used to narrow a userâ€™s permissions, not to potentially increase them.\n\nCLI run-as\n\nWith the CLI, run-as capability is on a per-request basis.

\"Run asâ€¦\" link.\n\nThen select the role in which you wish to operate:\n\nThe console will need to be restarted in order for the change to take effect.\n\nUsing run-as roles with the \"simple\" access control provider\n\nThis \"run-as\" capability is available even if the \"simple\" access control provider is used. When the \"simple\" provider is used, any authenticated administrator is treated the same as if they would map to SuperUser when the \"rbac\" provider is used.\n However, the \"simple\" provider actually understands all of the \"rbac\" provider configuration settings described above, but only makes use of them if the \"run-as\" capability is used for a request. Otherwise, the SuperUser role has all permissions, so detailed configuration is irrelevant.\n\nUsing the run-as capability with the \"simple\" provider may be useful if an administrator is setting up an rbac provider configuration before switching the provider to rbac to make that configuration take effect. The administrator can then run-as different roles to see the effect of the planned settings.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"5.

Commands\nDistributing deployment binaries involves two steps: uploading the deployment to the repository the domain controller will use to distribute its contents, and then assigning the deployment

Exploded managed deployments\n\nManaged and unmanaged deployments can be \u0027exploded\u0027, i.e. on the filesystem in the form of a directory structure whose structure corresponds to an unzipped version of the archive. An exploded deployment can be convenient to administer if your administrative processes involve inserting or replacing files from a base version in order to create a version tailored for a particular use (for example, copy in a base deployment and then copy in a jboss-web.xml file to tailor a deployment for use in WildFly.)

Deploying Using the Deployment Scanner\n\nDeployment content (for example, war, ear, jar, and sar files) can be placed in the standalone/deployments directory of the WildFly distribution, in order to be automatically deployed into the server runtime. For this to work the deployment-scanner subsystem must be present. The scanner periodically checks the contents of the deployments directory and reacts to changes by updating the server.\n\nUsers are encouraged to use the WildFly management APIs to upload and deploy deployment content instead of relying on the deployment scanner that periodically scans the directory, particularly if running production systems.      \nDeployment Scanner Modes\n\nThe WildFly filesystem deployment scanner operates in one of two different modes, depending on whether it will directly monitor the deployment content in order to decide to deploy or redeploy it.\n\nAuto-deploy mode:\n\nThe scanner will directly monitor the deployment content, automatically deploying new content and redeploying content whose timestamp has changed. This is similiar to the behavior of previous AS releases, although there are differences:\n\n*  A change in any file in an exploded deployment triggers redeploy.

the scanner relies on a system of marker files, with the userâ€™s addition or removal of a marker file serving as a sort of command telling the scanner to deploy, undeploy or redeploy content.\n\nAuto-deploy mode and manual deploy mode can be independently configured for zipped deployment content and exploded deployment content. This is done via the \"auto-deploy\" attribute on the deployment-scanner element in the standalone.xml configuration file:\n    \u003cdeployment-scanner scan-interval\u003d\"5000\" relative-to\u003d\"jboss.server.base.dir\" path\u003d\"deployments\" auto-deploy-zipped\u003d\"true\" auto-deploy-exploded\u003d\"false\"/\u003e    \nBy default, auto-deploy of zipped content is enabled, and auto-deploy of exploded content is disabled. Manual deploy mode is strongly recommended for exploded content, as exploded content is inherently vulnerable to the scanner trying to auto-deploy partially copied content.\n\nMarker Files\n\nThe marker files always have the same name as the deployment content to which they relate, but with an additional file suffix appended. For example, the marker file to indicate the example.war file should be deployed is named example.war.dodeploy.

Files\n\nThe marker files always have the same name as the deployment content to which they relate, but with an additional file suffix appended.\n\nFor example, the marker file to indicate the example.war\n\nfile should be deployed is named example.war.dodeploy.\n\nDifferent marker file suffixes have different meanings.\n\nThe relevant marker file types are:\n\nFile Purpose\n\n.dodeploy\n\nPlaced by the user to indicate that the given content should be deployed into the runtime (or redeployed if already deployed in the runtime.)\n\n.skipdeploy\n\nDisables auto-deploy of the content for as long as the file is present. Most useful for allowing updates to exploded content without having the scanner initiate redeploy in the middle of the update. Can be used with zipped content as well, although the scanner will detect in-progress changes to zipped content and wait until changes are complete.\n\n.isdeploying\n\nPlaced by the deployment scanner service to indicate that it has noticed a .dodeploy file or new or updated auto-deploymode content and is in the process of deploying the content.This marker file will be deleted when the deployment process completes.\n\n.deployed\n\nPlaced by the deployment scanner service to indicate that the given content has been deployed into the runtime.

It is a copy of that file stored in an internal content repository. The repository is located in the domain/data/content directory for a managed domain, or in standalone/data/content for a standalone server. Actual binaries are stored in a subdirectory:\n    ls domain/data/content/ |---/47 |-----95cc29338b5049e238941231b36b3946952991 |---/dd |-----a9881fa7811b22f1424b4c5acccb13c71202bd     \n     The location of the content repository and its internal structure is subject to change at any time and should not be relied upon by end users.      \nThe description of a managed deployment in the domain or standalone configuration file includes an attribute recording the SHA1 hash of the deployment content:\n    \u003cdeployments\u003e \u003cdeployment name\u003d\"test-application.war\" runtime-name\u003d\"test-application.war\"\u003e \u003ccontent sha1\u003d\"dda9881fa7811b22f1424b4c5acccb13c71202bd\"/\u003e \u003c/deployment\u003e \u003c/deployments\u003e    \nThe WildFly process calculates and records that hash when the user invokes a management operation (e.g. CLI deploy command or using the console) providing deployment content.

Unmanaged Deployments\n\nAn unmanaged deployment is one where the server directly deploys the content at a path you specify instead of making an internal copy and then deploying the copy.\n\nInitially deploying an unmanaged deployment is much like deploying a managed one, except you tell WildFly that you do not want the deployment to be managed:\n    [standalone@localhost:9990 /] deploy ~/Desktop/test-application.war --unmanaged \u0027test-application.war\u0027 deployed successfully.    \nWhen you do this, instead of the server making a copy of the content at /Desktop/test-application.war, calculating the hash of the content, storing the hash in the configuration file and then installing the copy into the runtime, instead it will convert /Desktop/test-application.war to an absolute path, store the path in the configuration file, and then install the original content in the runtime.\n\nYou can also use unmanaged deployments in a domain:\n    [domain@localhost:9990 /] deploy /home/example/Desktop/test-application.war --server-group\u003dmain-server-group --unmanaged \u0027test-application.war\u0027 deployed successfully.    \nHowever, before you run this command you must ensure that a copy of the content is present on all machines that have servers in the target server groups, all at the same filesystem path.

could be impractical if the name of a shared library changes very often or if there are many libraries you want to share. Both cases will require changes in the underlying module.xml that represents this global module.\n\nThe EE subsystem allows the configuration of a global directory, which represents a directory tree scanned automatically to include .jar files and resources as a single additional dependency. This module dependency is added as a system dependency on each deployed application.

EE subsystem allows the configuration of a global directory, which represents a directory tree scanned automatically to include .jar files and resources as a single additional dependency.\n\nThis module dependency is added as a system dependency on each deployed application.\n\nBasically, with a global directory, you will be relying on WildFly to automate the maintenance and configuration of a JBoss Modules module that represents the jar files and resources of a specific directory.\n\nYou can configure a global directory using the following operation:\n     [standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem\u003dee/global-directory\u003dmy-common-libs:add(path\u003dlib, relative-to\u003djboss.home.dir)    \nThe following attributes are available on the global-directory resource:\n\n*  path: The path of the directory to scan. (Mandatory)\n\n*  relative-to: The name of another previously named path, or of one of the standard paths provided by the system. (Optional)\n\nWhen a global-directory is created, the server establishes a JBoss Modules module with one Path Resource Loader created using \u0027path\u0027 and \u0027relative-to\u0027 attributes and one Jar Resource loader for each jar file included in this directory and its subdirectories.\n\nThe \u0027Path Resource Loader\u0027 will make available any file as a resource to the application.

For example, you could access the above property files using the context ClassLoader of your current thread:\n    Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(\"properties-1.properties\"); Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(\"A/B/properties-2.properties\");    \nAll classes inside of each jar file will also be available, and the order of how the resource-root are created internally will govern the order of the class loading. The jar resources of the generated module will be created iterating over all jar files found in the directory tree. Each directory is scanned alphabetically starting from the root, and on each level, each subdirectory is also explored alphabetically until visiting all the branch.

jar resources of the generated module will be created iterating over all jar files found in the directory tree.\n\nEach directory is scanned alphabetically starting from the root, and on each level, each subdirectory is also explored alphabetically until visiting all the branch.\n\nFiles found on each level are also added in alphabetical order.\n\nNotice you should know which classes are exposed on each .jar file and avoid conflicts including the same class twice with incompatible binary change. In those cases, classloading errors are likely to occur. Specifically, you should not add classes that interfere with the classes the server already makes available for your application; the goal of a global directory is not to override and replace existing library versions shipped with the server. It is a facility that will allow moving common frameworks you usually add to your application libs to a common place to facilitate maintenance.\n\nThe module created from the shared directory is loaded as soon as the first application is deployed in the server after creating the global-directory. That means, if the server is started/restarted and there are no applications deployed, then the global directory is neither scanned nor the module loaded.

WildFly Context Services are also used to propagate the context from a Jakarta EE application invocation thread, to the threads internally used by the other EE Concurrency Utilities.

jndi-name attribute is also mandatory, and defines where in the JNDI the Managed Executor Service should be placed.\n\nThe optional context-service references an existent Context Service by its name.

If not specified then a Managed Thread Factory with default configuration will be created and used internally.\n\nThe mandatory core-threads provides the number of threads to keep in the executorâ€™s pool, even if they are idle. If this is not defined or is set to 0, the core pool size will be calculated based on the number of available processors.\n\nThe optional queue-length indicates the number of tasks that can be stored in the input queue.

Binding aliases are specified through the lookup XML element. An example of its XML configuration:\n    \u003clookup name\u003d\"java:global/c\" lookup\u003d\"java:global/b\" /\u003e    \nThe name attribute is mandatory and specifies the target JNDI name for the entry.\n\nThe lookup attribute is mandatory and indicates the source JNDI name. It can chain lookups on external contexts.

JDBC Driver Installation\n\nThe recommended way to install a JDBC driver into WildFly 31 is to deploy it as a regular JAR deployment. The reason for this is that when you run WildFly in domain mode, deployments are automatically propagated to all servers to which the deployment applies; thus distribution of the driver JAR is one less thing for you to worry about!\n\nAny JDBC 4-compliant driver will automatically be recognized and installed into the system by name and version. A JDBC JAR is identified using the Java service provider mechanism. Such JARs will contain a text a file named META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver, which contains the name of the class(es) of the Drivers which exist in that JAR. If your JDBC driver JAR is not JDBC 4-compliant, it can be made deployable in one of a few ways.\n\nModify the JAR\n\nThe most straightforward solution is to simply modify the JAR and add the missing file. You can do this from your command shell by:\n\n*  Change to, or create, an empty temporary directory.\n\n*  Create a META-INF subdirectory.\n\n*  Create a META-INF/services subdirectory.\n\n*  Create a META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver file which contains one line - the fully-qualified class name of the JDBC driver.\n\n*  Use the jar command-line tool to update the JAR like this:\n      jar \\-uf jdbc-driver.jar META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver    \nFor a detailed explanation how to deploy JDBC 4 compliant driver jar, please refer to the chapter \" Application Deployment\".","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"7.

Common Datasource Definitions\n\nAgroal provides both XA and non-XA datasources and most of the attributes that define them are common. This definition is mainly split in two logical units: the connection factory and the connection pool. As the name implies, the connection factory has all that is required to create new connections and connection pool defines how connections are handled by the pool.\n\nConnection Factory definition\n\nThe connection factory requires a reference to a driver (see agroal-driver-installation).

main attributes of the connection-pool definition are the ones that control itâ€™s size. While the initial size attribute is only taken into account while bootstrapping the pool, min size and max size are always enforced and can be changed at any time without requiring a reload of the server.\n\nAnother important attribute of the connection-pool is the blocking timeout that defines the maximum amount of time a thread will wait for a connection. If that time elapses and still no connection is available an exception is thrown. Keep in mind that the default value is 0, meaning that a thread will wait forever for a connection to become available. Changing this setting does not require a reload of the server.\n\nThe connection pool provides other convenient features like background validation of connections on the pool, removal of idle connections from the pool and detection of connections held for too long by one thread.

Logging Profiles\n\nLogging profiles are like additional logging subsystems. Each logging profile constists of three of the four notable parts listed above: handler configurations, logger and the root logger declarations.\n\nYou can assign a logging profile to a deployment via the deployments manifest. Add a Logging-Profile entry to the MANIFEST.MF file with a value of the logging profile id. For example a logging profile defined on /subsystem\u003dlogging/logging-profile\u003dejbs the MANIFEST.MF would look like:\n    Manifest-Version: 1.0 Logging-Profile: ejbs    \nA logging profile can be assigned to any number of deployments. Using a logging profile also allows for runtime changes to the configuration. This is an advantage over the per-deployment logging configuration as the redeploy is not required for logging changes to take affect.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"7.

Default Log File Locations\n\nManaged Domain\n\nIn a managed domain two types of log files do exist: Controller and server logs. The controller components govern the domain as whole. Itâ€™s their responsibility to start/stop server instances and execute managed operations throughout the domain. Server logs contain the logging information for a particular server instance. They are co-located with the host the server is running on.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity we look at the default setup for managed domain. In this case, both the domain controller components and the servers are located on the same host:\n\nProcess Log File\n\nHost Controller\n\n./domain/log/host-controller.log\n\nProcess Controller\n\n./domain/log/process-controller.log\n\n\"Server One\"\n\n./domain/servers/server-one/log/server.log\n\n\"Server Two\"\n\n./domain/servers/server-two/log/server.log\n\n\"Server Three\"\n\n./domain/servers/server-three/log/server.log\n\nStandalone Server\n\nThe default log files for a standalone server can be found in the log subdirectory of the distribution:\n\nProcess Log File\n\nServer\n\n./standalone/log/server.log","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"7.

FAQ\n\nWhy is there a logging.properties file?\n\nYou may have noticed that there is a logging.properties file in the configuration directory. This is logging configuration is used when the server boots up until the logging subsystem kicks in. If the logging subsystem is not included in your configuration, then this would act as the logging configuration for the entire server.\n\nThe logging.properties file is overwritten at boot and with each change to the logging subsystem.

Handlers\n\nOverview\n\nHandlers define how log messages are recorded. If a message is said to be {oracle-javadocs}/java.logging/java/util/logging/Logger.html#isLoggable-java.util.logging.Level-[loggable] by a logger the message is then processed by the log handler.\n\nThe following are the available handlers for WildFly Full;\n\n*  async-handler\n\n*  console-handler\n\n*  custom-handler\n\n*  file-handler\n\n*  periodic-rotating-file-handler\n\n*  periodic-size-rotating-file-handler\n\n*  size-rotating-file-handler\n\n*  socket-handler\n\n*  syslog-handler\n\nasync-handler\n\nAn async-handler is a handler that asynchronously writes log messages to itâ€™s child handlers. This type of handler is generally used to wrap other handlers that take a substantial time to write messages.\n\nconsole-handler\n\nA console-handler is a handler that writes log messages to the console. Generally this writes to stdout, but can be set to write to stderr.\n\ncustom-handler\n\nA custom-handler allows you to define any handler as a handler that can be assigned to a logger or a async-handler.\n\nfile-handler\n\nA file-handler is a handler that writes log messages to the specified file.\n\nperiodic-rotating-file-handler\n\nA periodic-rotating-file-handler is a handler that writes log messages to the specified file. The file rotates on the date pattern specified in the suffix attribute.

syslog-handler is a handler that writes to a syslog server via UDP. The handler support RFC3164 or RFC5424 formats.\n\nThe syslog-handler is missing some configuration properties that may be useful in some scenarios like setting a formatter. Use the org.jboss.logmanager.handlers.SyslogHandler in module org.jboss.logmanager as a custom-handler to exploit these benefits.

Loggers\n\nWIP\n\nThis is still a work in progress. Please feel free to edit any mistakes you find       \nOverview\n\nLoggers are used to log messages. A logger is defined by a category generally consisting of a package name or a class name.\n\nA logger is the first step to determining if a messages should be logged or not. If a logger is defined with a level, the level of the message must be greater than the level defined on the logger. The filter is then checked next and the rules of the filter will determine whether or not the messages is said to be loggable.\n\nLogger Resource\n\nA logger resource uses the path subsystem\u003dlogging/logger\u003d$category where $category is the of the logger. For example to a logger named org.wildfly.example would have a resource path of subsystem\u003dlogging/logger\u003dorg.wildfly.example.\n\nA logger as 4 writeable attributes;\n\n*  filter-spec\n\n*  #handlers\n\n*  #level\n\n*  use-parent-handlers\n\nYou may notice that the category and filter attributes are missing. While filter is writable it may be deprecated and removed in the future.

Logging Filters\n\nFilters are used to add fine grained control over a log message. A filter can be assigned to a logger or log handler. See the Filter documentation for details on filters.\n\nFilter\n\nThe filter resource allows a custom filter to be used. The custom filter must reside in a module and implement the Filter interface.\n\nItâ€™s generally suggested to add filters to a handler. By default loggers do no inherit filters. This means if a filter is placed on a logger named org.jboss.as.logging is only checked if the logger name is equal to org.jboss.as.logging.\n\nExamples\n  Adding a filter  /subsystem\u003dlogging/filter\u003dmyFilter:add(class\u003dorg.jboss.example.MyFilter, module\u003dorg.jboss.example, properties\u003d{matches\u003d\"true\"}, constructor-properties\u003d{pattern\u003d\"*.WFLYLOG.*\"))    Nesting a filter  /subsystem\u003dlogging/console-handler\u003dCONSOLE:write-attribute(name\u003dfilter-spec, value\u003dnot(myFilter))      \nFilter Expressions\n\nFilter Type Expression Description Parameter(s) Examples\n\naccept\n\naccept\n\nAccepts all log messages.\n\nNone\n\naccept\n\ndeny\n\ndeny\n\nDenies all log messages.\n\nNone\n\ndeny\n\nnot\n\nnot(filterExpression)\n\nAccepts a filter as an argument and inverts the returned value.\n\nThe expression takes a single filter for itâ€™s argument.\n\nnot(match(\"JBAS\"))\n\nall\n\nall(filterExpressions)\n\nA filter consisting of several filters in a chain.

Cache factories may be passivating (an in-memory cache with the ability to passivate to persistant store the session states of beans not recently used and then activate them when needed) or non-passivating (an in-memory cache only). Default values for passivating and non-passivating caches are specified in the \u003cstateful\u003e element mentioned above. A SFSB may override the named cache used to store its session states via the @Cache annotation (in its class definition) or via a corresponding deployment descriptor.\n\n\u003csimple-cache\u003e\n\nThis element defines a non-passivating (in-memory only) cache factory for storing session states of a SFSB.\n\n\u003cdistributable-cache\u003e\n\nThis element defines a passivating cache factory (in-memory plus passivation to persistent store) for storing session states of a SFSB. A passivating cache factory relies on a bean-management provider to configure the passivation mechanism and the persistent store that it uses.\n\n*  bean-management This attribute specifies the bean-management provider to be used to support passivation of cache entries.

\u003cin-vm-remote-interface-invocation\u003e\n\nBy default remote interface invocations use pass by value, as required by the EJB spec. This element can use used to enable pass by reference, which can give you a performance boost. Note WildFly will do a shallow check to see if the caller and the EJB have access to the same class definitions, which means if you are passing something such as a List\u003cMyObject\u003e, WildFly only checks the List to see if it is the same class definition on the call \u0026 EJB side. If the top level class definition is the same, JBoss will make the call using pass by reference, which means that if MyObject or any objects beneath it are loaded from different classloaders, you would get a ClassCastException. If the top level class definitions are loaded from different classloaders, JBoss will use pass by value. JBoss cannot do a deep check of all of the classes to ensure no ClassCastExceptions will occur because doing a deep check would eliminate any performance boost you would have received by using call by reference. It is recommended that you configure pass by reference only on callers that you are sure will use the same class definitions and not globally.

\u003cclient-interceptors\u003e\n\nThis element configures a number of client-side interceptors which can be configured without changing the deployments.\n\nEach interceptor is configured in \u003cinterceptor\u003e tag which contains the following fields:\n\n*  module - the module in which the interceptor is defined\n\n*  class - the class which implements the interceptor\n\nIn order to use server interceptors you have to create a module that implements them and place it into ${WILDFLY_HOME}/modules directory.\n\nInterceptor implementations must implement org.jboss.ejb.client.EJBClientInterceptor interface.\n\nSample configuration:\n    \u003cclient-interceptors\u003e \u003cinterceptor module\u003d\"org.foo:FooInterceptor:1.0\"

Buffer cache configuration\n\nThe buffer cache is used for caching content, such as static files. Multiple buffer caches can be configured, which allows for separate servers to use different sized caches.\n\nBuffers are allocated in regions, and are of a fixed size.

Description\n\nname\n\nThe virtual host name\n\nalias\n\nA whitespace separated list of additional host names that should be matched\n\ndefault-web-module\n\nThe name of a deployment that should be used to serve up requests that do not match anything.\n\nqueue-requests-on-start\n\nIf requests should be queued on start for this host.\n\nIf this is set to false the default response code will be returned instead.\n\nNote: If a Non-graceful Startup is requested, and the queue-requests-on-start attribute is not set, requests will NOT be queued despite the default value of true for the property. In the instance of a non-graceful startup, non-queued requests are required. However, if non-graceful is configured, but queue-requests-on-start is explicitly set to true, then requests will be queued, effectively disabling the non-graceful mode for requests to that host.\n\nConsole Access Logging\n\nEach host allows for access logging to the console which writes structured data in JSON format. This only writes to stdout and is a single line of JSON structured data.\n\nThe attributes management model attribute is used to determine which exchange attributes should be logged. This is similar to the pattern used for traditional access logging.

Servlet container configuration\n\nThe servlet-container element corresponds to an instance of an Undertow Servlet container. Most servers will only need a single servlet container, however there may be cases where it makes sense to define multiple containers (in particular if you want applications to be isolated, so they cannot dispatch to each other using the RequestDispatcher. You can also use multiple Servlet containers to serve different applications from the same context path on different virtual hosts).\n\nAttribute Description\n\nallow-non-standard-wrappers\n\nThe Servlet specification requires applications to only wrap the request/response using wrapper classes that extend from the ServletRequestWrapper and ServletResponseWrapper classes. If this is set to true then this restriction is relaxed.\n\ndefault-buffer-cache\n\nThe buffer cache that is used to cache static resources in the default Servlet.\n\nstack-trace-on-error\n\nCan be either all, none, or local-only. When set to none Undertow will never display stack traces. When set to All Undertow will always display them (not recommended for production use). When set to local-only Undertow will only display them for requests from local addresses, where there are no headers to indicate that the request has been proxied.

Using WildFly as a Load Balancer\n\nWildFly 10 added support for using the Undertow subsystem as a load balancer. WildFly supports two different approaches, you can either define a static load balancer, and specify the back end hosts in your configuration, or use it as a mod_cluster frontend, and use mod_cluster to dynamically update the hosts.\n\nGeneral Overview\n\nWildFly uses Undertowâ€™s proxy capabilities to act as a load balancer. Undertow will connect to the back end servers using its built in client, and proxies requests.\n\nThe following protocols are supported:\n\n*  http\n\n*  ajp\n\n*  http2\n\n*  h2c (clear text HTTP2)\n Of these protocols h2c should give the best performance, if the back end servers support it.\n\nThe Undertow proxy uses async IO, the only threads that are involved in the request is the IO thread that is responsible for the connection. The connection to the back end server is made from the same thread, which removes the need for any thread safety constructs.\n If both the front and back end servers support server push, and HTTP2 is in use then the proxy also supports pushing responses to the client.

added load balancer profiles for both standalone and domain modes.\nExample: Start standalone load balancer   # configure correct path to WildFly installation WILDFLY_HOME\u003d/path/to/wildfly # configure correct IP of the node MY_IP\u003d192.168.1.1 # run the load balancer profile $WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b $MY_IP -bprivate $MY_IP -c standalone-load-balancer.xml\nItâ€™s highly recommended to use private/internal network for communication between load balancer and nodes. To do this set the correct IP address to the private interface (-bprivate argument).\nExample: Start worker node\nRun the server with the HA (or Full HA) profile, which has mod_cluster component included. If the UDP multicast is working in your environment, the workers should work out of the box without any change.

Jakarta Messaging Connection Factories\n\nThere are three kinds of basic Jakarta Messaging connection-factory that depends on the type of connectors that is used.\n\nThere is also a pooled-connection-factory which is special in that it is essentially a configuration facade for both the inbound and outbound connectors of the the Artemis Jakarta Connectors Resource Adapter. An MDB can be configured to use a pooled-connection-factory (e.g. using @ResourceAdapter). In this context, the MDB leverages the inbound connector of the Artemis Jakarta Connectors RA. Other kinds of clients can look up the pooled-connection-factory in JNDI (or inject it) and use it to send messages. In this context, such a client would leverage the outbound connector of the Artemis Jakarta Connectors RA. A pooled-connection-factory is also special because:\n\n*  It is only available to local clients, although it can be configured to point to a remote server.\n\n*  As the name suggests, it is pooled and therefore provides superior performance to the clients which are able to use it. The pool size can be configured via the max-pool-size and min-pool-size attributes.\n\n*  It should only be used to send (i.e. produce) messages when looked up in JNDI or injected.\n\n*  It can be configured to use specific security credentials via the user and password attributes.

 As the name suggests, it is pooled and therefore provides superior performance to the clients which are able to use it.\n\nThe pool size can be configured via the max-pool-size and min-pool-size attributes.\n\n*  It should only be used to send (i.e. produce) messages when looked up in JNDI or injected.\n\n*  It can be configured to use specific security credentials via the user and password attributes.\n\nThis is useful if the remote server to which it is pointing is secured.\n\n*  Resources acquired from it will be automatically enlisted any on-going Jakarta Transactions. If you want to send a message from an Jakarta Enterprise Beans using CMT then this is likely the connection factory you want to use so the send operation will be atomically committed along with the rest of the Jakarta Enterprise Beansâ€™s transaction operations.\n\nTo be clear, the inbound connector of the Artemis Jakarta Connectors RA (which is for consuming messages) is only used by MDBs and other Jakarta Connectors based components.

Jakarta Messaging Queues and Topics\n\nJakarta Messaging queues and topics are sub resources of the messaging-actively subsystem. One can define either a jms-queue or jms-topic. Each destination must be given a name and contain at least one entry in its entries element (separated by whitespace).\n\nEach entry refers to a JNDI name of the queue or topic. Keep in mind that any jms-queue or jms-topic which needs to be accessed by a remote client needs to have an entry in the \"java:jboss/exported\" namespace. As with connection factories, if a jms-queue or or jms-topic has an entry bound in the \"java:jboss/exported\" namespace a remote client would look it up using the text after \"java:jboss/exported`\". For example, the following `jms-queue \"testQueue\" is bound to \"java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/test\" which means a remote client would look-up this \\{{kms-queue} using \"jms/queue/test\".

SSL Configuration\nThe preferred way is to reuse an SSLContext defined in the Elytron subsystem and reference it using the ssl-context attribute available on http-acceptor, remote-acceptor, http-connector and remote-acceptor. That way you can use the SSLContext with the broker but also with other services such as Undertow. One point that you have to take into account is the fact that the connector might be used on a different point than the server you have configured it on. For example, if you obtain the connection factory remotely using JNDI, the SSLContext configured in the connector is \u0027relative\u0027 to your client and not to the server it was configured.

Jakarta Messaging Bridge\n\nThe function of a Jakarta Messaging bridge is to consume messages from a source Jakarta Messaging destination, and send them to a target Jakarta Messaging destination. Typically either the source or the target destinations are on different servers. The bridge can also be used to bridge messages from other non Artemis messaging servers, as long as they are JMS 1.1 compliant.\n\nThe Jakarta Messaging Bridge is provided by the Artemis project. For a detailed description of the available configuration properties, please consult the project documentation.\n\nModules for other messaging brokers\n\nSource and target Jakarta Messaging resources (destination and connection factories) are looked up using JNDI. If either the source or the target resources are managed by another messaging server than WildFly, the required client classes must be bundled in a module.

standard way is to define a destinationLookup activation config property that corresponds to a JNDI lookup on the local server.\nWhen the MDB is consuming from a remote Artemis server it will now create those bindings locally.\nIt is possible to use the naming subsystem to configure external context federation to have local JNDI bindings delegating to external bindings.\nHowever there is a simpler solution to configure the destination when using the Artemis Resource Adapter.\nInstead of using JDNI to lookup the Jakarta Messaging Destination resource, you can just specify the name of the destination (as configured in the remote Artemis server) using the destination activation config property and set the useJNDI activation config property to false to let the Artemis Resource Adapter create automatically the Jakarta Messaging destination without requiring any JNDI lookup.\n@ResourceAdapter(\"remote-artemis\") @MessageDriven(name \u003d \"MyMDB\", activationConfig \u003d {

@JMSDestinationDefinition can be used to create a destination on a remote Artemis Server. This will work in the same way as for a local server. For this it needs to be able to access Artemis management queue.

legacy client will then lookup these legacy messaging resources to communicate with WildFly.\n\nTo avoid any code change in the legacy messaging clients, the legacy JNDI entries must match the lookup expected by the legacy client.\n\nMigration\n\nDuring migration, the legacy messaging subsystem will create a legacy-connection-factory resource and add legacy-entries to the jms-queue and jms-topic resource if the boolean attribute add-legacy-entries is set to true for its migrate operation. If that is the case, the legacy entries in the migrated messaging-activemq subsystem will correspond to the entries specified in the legacy messaging subsystem and the regular entries will be created with a -new suffix.\n If add-legacy-entries is set to false during migration, no legacy resources will be created in the messaging-activemq subsystem and legacy messaging clients will not be able to communicate with WildFly 31 servers.\n\nBackward Compatibility\n\nBackward compatibility requires no configuration change in the legacy server.\n WildFly 31 clients do not look up resources on the legacy server but use client-side JNDI to create their Jakarta Messaging resources.

AIO - NIO for messaging journal\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis (like HornetQ beforehand) ships with a high performance journal. Since Apache ActiveMQ Artemis handles its own persistence, rather than relying on a database or other 3rd party persistence engine it is very highly optimised for the specific messaging use cases. The majority of the journal is written in Java, however we abstract out the interaction with the actual file system to allow different pluggable implementations.\n\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with two implementations:\n\n*  Java NIO.\n\nThe first implementation uses standard Java NIO to interface with the file system. This provides extremely good performance and runs on any platform where thereâ€™s a Java 6+ runtime.\n\n*  Linux Asynchronous IO\n\nThe second implementation uses a thin native code wrapper to talk to the Linux asynchronous IO library (AIO).

If AIO is not supported on the system then Artemis will fallback to NIO. To know which type of journal is effectively used you can execute the following command using jboss-cli:\n    /subsystem\u003dmessaging-activemq/server\u003ddefault:read-attribute(name\u003druntime-journal-type)    \nPlease note that AIO is represented by ASYNCIO in the WildFly model configuration.\n\nAlso, please note that AIO will only work with the following file systems: ext2, ext3, ext4, jfs, xfs. With other file systems, e.g. NFS it may appear to work, but it will fall back to a slower synchronous behaviour.

JDBC Store for Messaging Journal\n\nThe Artemis server that are integrated to WildFly can be configured to use a JDBC store for its messaging journal instead of its file-based journal.\n The server resource of the messaging-activemq subsystem needs to configure its journal-datasource attribute to be able to use JDBC store. If this attribute is not defined, the regular file-base journal will be used for the Artemis server.\n This attribute value must correspond to a data source defined in the datasource subsystem.\n\nFor example, if the datasources subsystem defines an ExampleDS data source at /subsystem\u003ddatasources/data-source\u003dExampleDS, the Artemis server can use it for its JDBC store with the operation:\n    /subsystem\u003dmessaging-activemq/server\u003ddefault:write-attribute(name\u003djournal-datasource, value\u003dExampleDS)    \nArtemis JDBC store uses SQL commands to create the tables used to persist its information.\n These SQL commands may differ depending on the type of database.

name of these tables can be configured with the journal-bindings-table, journal-messages-table, journal-page-store-table, and journal-large-messages-table.\nPlease note that the configuration of the underlying pool is something that you need to take care of.\nYou need at least four connections:\n*  one for the binding\n*  one for the messages journal\n*  one for the lease lock (if you use HA)\n*  one for the node manager shared state (if you use HA)\nSo you should define a min-pool-size of 4 for the pool.\nBut one fact that you need to take into account is that paging and large messages can use an unbounded number of threads. The size, a.k.a. max-pool-size, of the pool should be defined according to the amount of concurrent threads that perform page/large message streaming operations. There is no defined rule for this as there is no 1-1 relation between the number of threads and the number of connections. The number of connections depend on the number of threads processing paging and large messages operations as well as the time you are willing to wait to get a connection (cf. blocking-timeout-wait-millis).

Configuring Broadcast/Discovery\n\nEach Artemis server can be configured to broadcast itself and/or discovery other Artemis servers within a cluster. Artemis supports two mechanisms for configuring broadcast/discovery:\n\nJGroups-based broadcast/discovery\n\nArtemis can leverage the membership of an existing JGroups channel to both broadcast its identity and discover nodes on which Artemis servers are deployed.

supports two mechanisms for configuring broadcast/discovery:\nJGroups-based broadcast/discovery\nArtemis can leverage the membership of an existing JGroups channel to both broadcast its identity and discover nodes on which Artemis servers are deployed.\nWildFlyâ€™s default full-ha profile uses this mechanism for broadcast/discovery using the default JGroups channel of the server (as defined by the JGroups subsystem).\nTo add this support to a profile that does not include it by default, use the following:\n[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem\u003dmessaging-activemq/server\u003ddefault/broadcast-group\u003dbg-group1:add(jgroups-cluster\u003dactivemq-cluster,connectors\u003dhttp-connector) [standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem\u003dmessaging-activemq/server\u003ddefault/discovery-group\u003ddg-group1:add(jgroups-cluster\u003dactivemq-cluster)\nTo segregate Artemis servers use a distinct membership, configure broadcast/discovery using a separate channel. To do this, first create the channel resource:\n[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem\u003djgroups/channel\u003dmessaging:add(stack\u003dtcp)\nThis creates a new JGroups channel resource based on the \"tcp\" protocol stack.

load balancer we need to indicate to the clients that they must not use the cluster topology to connect to it but keep on using the initial connection to the load-balancer. For this you need to specify on the (pooled) connection factory not to use the topology by setting the attribute \"use-topology-for-load-balancing\" to false.\n    /subsystem\u003dmessaging-activemq/pooled-connection-factory\u003dremote-artemis:write-attribute(name\u003d\"use-topology-for-load-balancing\", value\u003d\"false\")     \nNetwork Isolation (Split Brain)\n\nIt is possible that if a replicated live or backup server becomes isolated in a network that failover will occur and you will end up with 2 live servers serving messages in a cluster, this we call split brain.

Transaction subsystem configuration\n\nTransaction subsystem configures the behaviour of the transaction manager. Narayana is the transaction manager used in WildFly. The second component configured within the subsystem is WildFly Transaction Client (the WFTC serves as an abstract layer to work with the transactional context).\n\nConfiguration of Narayana component\n\nThe structure of the transaction subsystem follows the structure of Narayana component. Narayana defines a separate configuration bean for every internal module. For example any configuration related to Narayana core is available through beans CoordinatorEnvironmentBean and CoreEnvironmentBean, for JTA processing it is JTAEnvironmentBean, for the transaction recovery setup itâ€™s RecoveryEnvironmentBean.\n\nThe transaction subsystem provides only a sub-set of the configuration available via Narayana beans. Any other configuration option provided by Narayana is still possible to be configured via system properties and JVM restart is usually required.\n\nNarayana defines unified naming for the system properties which are used for configuration. The system property is in form [bean name].[property name].

Exposed Metrics\n\nThe HTTP endpoint exposes the following metrics:\n\n*  Base metrics - Metrics from JVM MBeans (read from their JMX MBeans)\n\n*  Vendor metrics - WildFly Metrics from the management model subsystem and deployment subtrees.\n\nThe HTTP endpoint exposes the metrics in the Prometheus format only.\n\nWildFly Metrics Description\n\nWildFly metrics names are based on the subsystem that provides them as well as the name of the attribute from the management model. Their name can also be prepended with a prefix (specified on the /subsystem\u003dmetrics resource). Other information is stored using labels.\n\nFor example Undertow exposes a metric attribute request-count for every Servlet in an application deployment. This attribute will be exposed to Prometheus with the name wildfly_undertow_request_count. Other information such as the name of the Servlet are added to the labels of the metrics.\n\nThe helloworld quickstart demonstrates the use of CDI and Servlet in Wildfly.

Metrics Description\n\nWildFly metrics names are based on the subsystem that provides them, as well as the name of the attribute from the management model.\n\nFor example Undertow exposes a metric attribute request-count for every Servlet in an application deployment.\n\nThis attribute will be exposed with the name undertow_request_count.\n\nOther information such as the name of the Servlet are added to the tags of the metric.\n\nThe helloworld quickstart demonstrates the use of CDI and Servlet in WildFly. A corresponding metric will be exposed for it with the name and tags:\n    undertow_request_count_total{deployment\u003d\"helloworld.war\",servlet\u003d\"org.jboss.as.quickstarts.helloworld.HelloWorldServlet\",subdeployment\u003d\"helloworld.war\"} 4.0     \n     Some subsystems (such as undertow or messaging-activemq) do not enable their statistics by default as they have an impact on performance and memory usage. These subsystems provide a statistics-enabled attribute that must be set to true to enable them. For convenience, WildFly standalone configuration provides expressions to enable the statistics by setting a System property -Dwildfly.statistics-enabled\u003dtrue to enable statistics on the subsystems provided by the configuration.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"7.

Use in Applications\n\nUnlike the previous metrics systems, this new extension exposes an API (that of Micrometer) to applications in order to allow developers to record and export metrics out of the box. To do so, application developers will need to inject a MeterRegistry instance:\n    package com.redhat.wildfly.micrometerdemo; import jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped; import jakarta.inject.Inject; import jakarta.ws.rs.GET; import jakarta.ws.rs.Path; import io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry; @RequestScoped @Path(\"/endpoint\") public class Endpoint { @Inject private MeterRegistry registry; @GET public String method() { registry.counter(\"dummy\").increment(); return \"Counter is \" + registry.counter(\"dummy\").count(); } }    \nThis provides the application with a MeterRegistry instance that will have any recorded metrics exported with the system metrics WildFly already exposes. There is no need for an application to include the Micrometer dependencies in the application archive, as they are provided by the server out-of-the-box:\n    \u003cdependency\u003e \u003cgroupId\u003eio.micrometer\u003c/groupId\u003e \u003cartifactId\u003emicrometer-core\u003c/artifactId\u003e \u003cversion\u003e${version.micrometer}\u003c/version\u003e \u003cscope\u003eprovided\u003c/scope\u003e \u003c/dependency\u003e","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"7.

Configuration\n\nSystems administrators can configure a number of aspects of OpenTelemetry: the exporter, span processor, and sampler.\n\nExporter\n\nThe exporter can be selected and configured using the exporter child element, which supports these attributes:\n\n*  exporter: WildFly currently supports only one exporter\n\n*  otlp: The default, which use the OpenTelemetry protocol\n\n*  endpoint: The URL via which OpenTelemetry will push traces. The default is OTLPâ€™s gRPC-based endpoint, http://localhost:4317\n\nIMPORTANT CHANGE  \nEarlier versions of WildFly supported jaeger as a valid exporter type. Jaeger support, however, has been dropped by the OpenTelemetry project upstream, so its support has been removed from WildFly as well. Any server configurations with jaeger still configured will fail to start the opentelemetry subsystem and apps using OpenTelemetry will fail to deploy until the server is reconfigured to use otlp. You can, however, start the server in admin-only mode in order to reconfigure the value.

HTTP Endpoint\n\nThe Health HTTP endpoint is accessible on the WildFly HTTP management interface http://localhost:9990/health.\n\nThe health subsystem registers three HTTP endpoints:\n\n*  /health to test both the liveness and readiness of the application server.\n\n*  /health/live to test the liveness of the application server\n\n*  /health/ready to test the readiness of the application server.\n\n*  /health/started to test the startup of the application server.\n\nThe Health HTTP endpoints are accessible on the WildFly HTTP management interface (e.g. http://localhost:9990/health).\n\nIf the application server is healthy, it will return a 200 OK response:\n    $ curl -v http://localhost:9990/health \u003c HTTP/1.1 200 OK    \nIf the application server is not healthy, it returns 503 Service Unavailable\n    $ curl -v http://localhost:9990/health \u003c HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable    \nSecured Access to the HTTP endpoints\n\nSecured access to the HTTP endpoint is controlled by the security-enabled attribute. If it is set to true, the HTTP client must be authenticated.\n\nIf security has been enabled, the HTTP client must pass the credentials corresponding to a management user created by the add-user script.

dir value corresponds to the mountPath in the ConfigMap definition in OpenShift or Kubernetes.\n\nConfigSources from Root directory\n\nYou can also point to a root directory by adjusting the examples in the preceding section to include root\u003dtrue when defining them. Top level directories within this root directory each become an individual ConfigSource reading from a directory similar to what we saw earlier in ConfigSource from Directory. Any directories below the top-level directories are ignored. Also, any files in the root directory are ignored; only files in the top level directories within the root directory will be used for the configuration.\n\nThis is especially useful when running on OpenShift where constructs such as ConfigMap and ServiceBinding instances get mapped under a common known location. For example if there are two ConfigMap instances (for this example, we will call them map-a, and map-b) used by your application pod, they will each get mapped under /etc/config.

example if there are two ConfigMap instances (for this example, we will call them map-a, and map-b) used by your application pod, they will each get mapped under /etc/config.\n\nSo you would have /etc/config/map-a and /etc/config/map-b directories.\n\nEach of these directories will have files where the file name is the name of the property and the file content is the value of the property, like we saw earlier.\n\nWe can thus simply run the following CLI command to pick up all these child directories as a ConfigSource each:\n    /subsystem\u003dmicroprofile-config-smallrye/config-source\u003dconfig-map-root:add(dir\u003d{path\u003d/etc/config, root\u003dtrue})    \nThis results in the XML configuration:\n    \u003csubsystem xmlns\u003d\"urn:wildfly:microprofile-config-smallrye:2.0\"\u003e \u003cconfig-source name\u003d\"config-map-root\"\u003e \u003cdir path\u003d\"/etc/config\" root\u003d\"true\"/\u003e \u003c/config-source\u003e \u003c/subsystem\u003e    \nAssuming the /etc/config directory contains the map-a and map-b directories we are using for this example, the above is analogous to doing:\n    /subsystem\u003dmicroprofile-config-smallrye/config-source\u003dfile-props:add(dir\u003d{path\u003d/etc/config/map-a}) /subsystem\u003dmicroprofile-config-smallrye/config-source\u003dfile-props:add(dir\u003d{path\u003d/etc/config/map-b})    \nSpecifying the root directory rather than each individual directory removes the need to know the exact names of each entry under the common parent directory (this is especially useful in some OpenShift scenarios where the names of these directories are

situation where two ConfigSource entries under the same root both contain the same property should be avoided. However, to make this situation deterministic, the directories representing each ConfigSource are sorted by their name according to standard Java sorting rules before doing the lookup of values. To make this more concrete, if we have the following entries: * /etc/config/map-a/name contains kabir * /etc/config/map-b/name contains jeff\n\nSince map-a will come before map-b after sorting, in the following scenario kabir (coming from map-a) will be injected for the following username field:\n    @Inject @ConfigProperty(name \u003d \"name\") String username;    \nYou may override this default sorting by including a file called config_ordinal in a directory. The ordinal specified in that file will be used for config values coming from that directory. Building on our previous example, if we had: * /etc/config/map-a/config_ordinal contains 120 * /etc/config/map-b/config_ordinal contains 140\n\nSince now map-b has a higher ordinal (140) than map-a (120), we will instead inject the value jeff for the earlier username field.\n\nIf there is no config_ordinal file in a top-level directory under the root directory, the ordinal used when specifying the ConfigSource will be used for that directory.\n\nConfigSource from Class\n\nYou can create a specific type of ConfigSource implementation by creating a config-source resource with a class attribute.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"7.

the deployments are processed, namely empty-readiness-checks, empty-startup-checks, and empty-liveness-checks. This means that the server might prematurely respond with invalid UP response particularly to startup and readiness invocations before the user deployment is processed. For this reason, MicroProfile Health specification defines two MicroProfile Config properties that specify the response returned while the server is still processing deployments, i.e. it returns an empty health response:\n\n*  mp.health.default.readiness.empty.response (default DOWN) that specifies empty readiness response. This response will be switched to UP once the user deployment is processed even if it doesnâ€™t contain any readiness checks.

Virtual Security\n\nFor traditional deployments to WildFly where security is required a security domain name would be identified during deployment and this in turn would be mapped to use configured resources either within the elytron or legacy security subsystems.\n\nOne of the main motivations for using MicroProfile JWT is the ability to describe an identity from the incoming token without relying on access to external resources. For this reason MicroProfile JWT deployments will not depend on managed SecurityDomain resources, instead a virtual SecurityDomain will be created and used across the deployment.\n\nAs the deployment is configured entirely within the MicroProfile Config properties other than the presence of the microprofile-jwt-smallrye subsystem the virtual SecurityDomain means no other managed configuration is required for the deployment.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"7.

Configuration\n\nThe microprofile-openapi-smallrye subsystem obtains all of its configuration via MicroProfile Config. Thus the subsystem itself defines no attributes.\n\nIn addition to the standard Open API configuration properties, WildFly supports the following additional MicroProfile Config properties:\n\nProperty Default Description\n\nmp.openapi.extensions.enabled\n\ntrue\n\nEnables/disables registration of an OpenAPI endpoint.

HTTP/S Endpoint\n\nThe MicroProfile OpenAPI specification defines an HTTP endpoint that serves an OpenAPI 3.0 document describing the REST endpoints for the host. The OpenAPI endpoint is registered using the configured path (e.g. http://localhost:8080/openapi) local to the root of the host associated with a given deployment.\n\nCurrently, the OpenAPI endpoint for a given virtual host can only document a single JAX-RS deployment. To use OpenAPI with multiple JAX-RS deployments registered with different context paths on the same virtual host, each deployment should use a distinct endpoint path.      \nBy default, the OpenAPI endpoint returns a YAML document. Alternatively, a JSON document can be requested via an Accept HTTP header, or a format query parameter.\n\ne.g.\n    $ curl -v http://localhost:8080/openapi?format\u003dJSON \u003c HTTP/1.1 200 OK ... {\"openapi\": \"3.0.1\" ... } $ curl -v -H\u0027Accept: application/json\u0027 http://localhost:8080/openapi \u003c HTTP/1.1 200 OK ... {\"openapi\": \"3.0.1\" ... }    \nIf the Undertow server/host of a given application defines an HTTPS listener, then the OpenAPI document will also be available via HTTPS, e.g. https://localhost:8443/openapi","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"7.

Specification\n\nWildFlyâ€™s MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators subsystem implements MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators 2.0, which adds support for asynchronous streaming of data.

Configuration\n\nThe microprofile-reactive-messaging-smallrye subsystem contains no configurable attributes or resources. For the core MicroProfile Reactive Messaging functionality there is no configuration. For configuration of the connectors to external brokers MicroProfile Config is used.\n\nActivation\n\nThe subsystem will scan all deployments to find classes containing methods with the org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming or org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing annotations. If these annotations are found, Reactive Messaging will be enabled for the deployment.\n\nProgramming model and Limitations\n\nSee the spec for more thorough examples, this section just attempts to summarize the highlights.\n\nVersion 1.0 of the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification introduced the @Incoming and @Outgoing annotations. They are intended for use in an @ApplicationScoped (or @Dependent) CDI bean:\n    @ApplicationScoped public class MyBean { @Outgoing(\"in-memory\") public String generate() { return ...; // Do some generation of values } @Incoming(\"in-memory\") public void consume(String value) { System.out.println(value); } }    \nValues generated by the generate() method will be received by the consume() method. In this basic setup where the channel names match, the streams are dealt with in-memory.

this basic setup where the channel names match, the streams are dealt with in-memory.\n\nWeâ€™ll see how to have them handled by Kafka later on.\n\nIn the above example, we are essentially generating values and consuming them with no user-interaction. MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 2.0 introduces a @Channel annotation, which can be used to inject a Publisher for receiving values sent on streams, and an Emitter which can be used to send values to a stream. This makes it easier to send/receive values from code paths resulting from user interaction:\n    @ApplicationScoped public class MyBean { @Inject @Channel(\"in-memory\") Emitter\u003cString\u003e emitter; @Inject @Channel(\"in-memory\") Publisher\u003cString\u003e publisher; void send(String value) { emitter.send(value); } }    \nIn the above example we can now easily send data to the Reactive Messaging streams by calling Emitter.send(). Similarly, we can subscribe to the Publisher and receive the data. However, receiving still has a few shortcomings:\n\n*  The above example will not work out of the box. When trying to send on the Emitter, you will get an error that there are no subscibers (which in turn runs the risk of causing overflow).

we can subscribe to the Publisher and receive the data.\n\nHowever, receiving still has a few shortcomings:\n\n*  The above example will not work out of the box.\n\nWhen trying to send on the Emitter, you will get an error that there are no subscibers (which in turn runs the risk of causing overflow).\n\nThis can be worked around by creating a subscription on the Publisher.\n\n*  At present there can only be one subscription on the injected Publisher.\n\nThe above points means that this Publisher is not usable directly as an asynchronous return value for e.g. a Jakarta RESTFul Webservices endpoint. As the Jakarta RESTFul Webservices request is what will create the subscription such a call would need to happen before calling Emitter.send().\n\nIf we replace the Emitter with the generate() method from the original method our example will work. However, if we return the Publisher to more than one Jakarta RESTFul Webservices request, we end up with more than one subscriptions which will not all receive every single value.\n\nUserâ€™s applications intended to return published values to users via e.g. Jakarta RESTFul Webservices will need to do their own subscriptions and buffering of the data. Care must be taken to not let the cache grow uncontrolled, which could cause OutOfMemoryErrors.\n\nConnectors\n\nMicroProfile Reactive Messaging is designed to be flexible enough to integrate with a wide variety of external messaging systems.

User API  \nIn order to be able to get more information about messages received from Kafka, and to be able to influence how Kafka handles messages, there is a user API for Kafka.\n\nThis API lives in the io/smallrye/reactive/messaging/kafka/api package.\n\nThe API consists of the following classes:\n\n*  IncomingKafkaRecordMetadata - This metadata contains information such as:\n\n*  the key of the Kafka record represented by a Message\n\n*  the Kafka topic and partition used for the Message, and the offset within those\n\n*  the Message timestamp and timestampType\n\n*  the Message headers - these are pieces of information the application can attach on the producing side, and receive on the consuming side. They are stored and forwarded on by Kafka but have no meaning to Kafka itself.\n\n*  OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata - This is constructed via the builder returned via the builder() method, and allows you to specify/override how Kafka will handle the messages. Similar to the IncomingKafkaRecordMetadata case, you can set:\n\n*  the key. Kafka will then treat this entry as the key of the message\n\n*  the topic, as already seen we typically use the microprofile-config.properties configuration to specify the topic to use for a channel backed by Kafka. However, in some cases the code sending the message might need to make some choices (for example depending on values contained in the data) about which topic to send to.

we will briefly discuss each of these entries.\n\nRemember the to channel is on the send() method, and the from channel is on the receive() method.\n\nThe entries amqp-host\u003dlocalhost and amqp-port\u003d5672 point the connector to an AMQP broker running on localhost:5672.\n\nAs before we could also have done these for an individual channel by for example specifying mp.messaging.outgoing.to.host\u003dlocalhost instead.\n\nIf the host is not specified, it defaults to localhost.\n\nmp.messaging.outgoing.to.connector\u003dsmallrye-amqp says that we want to use AMQP to back the to channel. Note that the value smallrye-amqp is SmallRye Reactive Messaging specific, and will only be understood if the AMQP connector is enabled.\n\nmp.messaging.outgoing.to.address\u003dmy-topic says that we will send data via to channel to the AMQP queue on address called my-topic.\n\nmp.messaging.incoming.from.connector\u003dsmallrye-amqp says that we want to use AMQP to back the from channel.

Any server configuration related to OpenTelemetry should be made to the opentelemetry subsystem, the documentation for which can be found in the relevant section of the Administration Guide.\n\nThe MicroProfile Telemetry subsystem does, however, allow for individual applications to override any server configuration via MicroProfile Config. For example, the default service name used in exported traces is derived from the deployment name, so if the deployment archive is my-application-1.0.war, the service name will be my-application-1.0.war. This can be overridden using the standard OpenTelemetry configuration properties (documented here):\n    otel.service.name\u003dMy Application    \nNote also that, per spec requirements, MicroProfile Telemetry is disabled by default and must be manually enabled on a per-application basis:\n    otel.sdk.disabled\u003dfalse","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"7.

Structure of the webservices subsystem\n\nPublished endpoint address\n\nJBossWS supports the rewriting of the \u003csoap:address\u003e element of endpoints published in WSDL contracts.

This feature provides a convenient way to add handlers to WS endpoints and to set key/value properties that control JBossWS and Apache CXF internals ( see Apache CXF configuration).\n\nThe webservices subsystem provides schema to support the definition of named sets of endpoint configuration data.

Job Repository\n\nThe batch subsystem supports 2 types of job repository:\n\n*  in-memory job repository: all job execution data are kept in the memory of WildFly instance. When the server shuts down, all job execution data are lost. In a clustered environment, each WildFly server instance has its own in-memory job repository, and it is not possible to share job execution data between WildFly instances. This is the default job repository in batch subsystem.\n\n*  jdbc job repository: all job execution data are saved in a relational database accessed via jdbc. In a clustered environment, a jdbc job repository can be used to share job execution data between WildFly instances. For example, one may start a job execution in one instance, stop and restart it from a different WildFly instance.\n\nHandling Large Job Repositories\n\nIn some cases, when a job repository accumulates a large number of job execution records (say hundreds of thousands), application deployment times may be negatively impacted.

Deployment Descriptors\n\nThere are no deployment descriptors for configuring a batch environment defined by the JSR-352 specification. In WildFly you can use a jboss-all.xml deployment descriptor to define aspects of the batch environment for your deployment.\n\nIn the jboss-all.xml deployment descriptor you can define a named job repository, a new job repository and/or a named thread pool.

JAXRS Subsystem Configuration\n\nThe jaxrs subsystem represents Jakarta RESTful Web Services. RESTEasy is the implementation.\n\nRequired Extension:\n\nThe required extension is in the module org.jboss.as.jaxrs. In most cases the extension should be present. However, if it is not you can add it with CLI.\n    /extension\u003dorg.jboss.as.jaxrs:add    \nThis adds the following configuration entry:\n    \u003cextension module\u003d\"org.jboss.as.jaxrs\"/\u003e     \nBasic Subsystem Configuration Example:\n\nBy default the jaxrs subsystem is empty which results in default configuration values being used.\n\nThis can be changed with a management client such as the CLI or the web console.

The hyphens are translated into periods before the parameters are passed into RESTEasy so that they conform to the RESTEasy parameter names.\n\nFor a discussion of the various parameters, see the RESTEasy User Guide.\n\nOne important thing to understand is that these parameters are global. That is, they apply to all deployments. Since these parameters are global, the classes referred to in \"resteasy.providers\" and \"resteasy.disable.providers\" must be available to all deployments. In practice, then, they are meant to enable or disable RESTEasy providers. Note that they can be used in conjunction with \"resteasy-use-builtin-providers\" to tailor a set of available providers.       \n     Another important fact is that once parameters are changed via some management interface the changes require a redeployment of any applications previously deployed.       \n     RESTEasy has introduced a new treatment of jakarta.ws.rs.WebApplicationException\u0027s thrown by a Jakarta REST client or MicroProfile REST Client running inside a RESTful resource, in which the embedded jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response is \"sanitized\" before being returned to prevent the risk of information leaking from a third party.

configuration to your deployment to secure it with OpenID Connect as described in the previous section, another option is to add configuration to the elytron-oidc-client subsystem instead.\n\nThe following example shows how to add configuration to the elytron-oidc-client subsystem.\n    \u003csubsystem xmlns\u003d\"urn:wildfly:elytron-oidc-client:1.0\"\u003e \u003csecure-deployment

\u003c/subsystem\u003e    \nThe secure-deployment resource allows you to provide configuration for a specific deployment.

Virtual Security\n\nThe purpose of using OpenID Connect is to verify a userâ€™s identity based on the authentication thatâ€™s been performed by the OpenID provider. For this reason, OpenID Connect deployments do not depend on security-domain resources that have been defined in the Elytron subsystem, like traditional deployments do. Instead, the elytron-oidc-client subsystem will automatically create and make use of its own virtual security domain across the deployment.

OpenID Providers\n\nThe provider-url attribute in the oidc.json configuration and in the elytron-oidc-client subsystem configuration allows you to specify the URL for the OpenID provider that youâ€™d like to use. For WildFly 25, the elytron-oidc-client subsystem has been tested with the Keycloak OpenID provider. Other OpenID providers havenâ€™t been extensively tested yet so the use of other OpenID providers should be considered experimental for now and should not be used in a production environment yet. Proper support for other OpenID providers will be added in a future WildFly release.\n\nDisabling \"typ\" Claim Validation\n\nBy default, when verifying an access token, the elytron-oidc-client subsystem expects the token to contain a typ claim with value Bearer. Access tokens provided by the Keycloak OpenID provider contain this claim. However, access tokens provided by other OpenID providers might not include this claim, causing token validation to fail. When using an OpenID provider other than Keycloak, it is possible to disable the typ claim validation by setting the wildfly.elytron.oidc.disable.typ.claim.validation system property to true.","metadata":{"metadata":{"file_path":"target/test-classes/admin_guide.html","parent_url":"https://docs.wildfly.org/31/","file_name":"admin_guide.html","subtitle":"7.

Identity Propagation\n\nWhen securing an application with OpenID Connect, the elytron-oidc-client subsystem will automatically create a virtual security domain for you. If your application invokes an EJB, additional configuration might be required to propagate the security identity from the virtual security domain depending on how the EJB is being secured.\n\nSecuring an EJB using a different security domain\n\nIf your application secured with OpenID Connect invokes an EJB within the same deployment (e.g., within the same WAR or EAR) or invokes an EJB in a separate deployment (e.g., across EARs) and youâ€™d like to secure the EJB using a different security domain from your servlet, additional configuration will be needed to outflow the security identities established by the virtual security domain to another security domain.\n\nThe virtual-security-domain resource allows you to specify that security identities established by a virtual security domain should automatically be outflowed to other security domains.

Securing the management console with OpenID Connect\n\nThe management console can be secured with OpenID Connect using the Keycloak OpenID provider.\n\nThe ability to secure the management console with the Keycloak OpenID provider is only available when running a standalone server and is not supported when running a managed domain. The management CLI cannot be secured with OpenID Connect.\n\nTo secure the management console with OpenID Connect, configuration is required on the Keycloak side and in the elytron-oidc-client subsystem.\n\nKeycloak Configuration\n\nFollow the steps in Keycloakâ€™s getting started guide to add a new realm called wildfly-infra.\n\nThen, create a new OpenID Connect client called wildfly-console. Set the Valid Redirect URIs using the URI used to access the WildFly management console, e.g., http://localhost:9990/console/. Similarly, youâ€™ll also need to set *Web Origins using the management port for your WildFly instance, e.g., http://localhost:9990.\n\nNext, create a second OpenID Connect client called wildfly-management.
